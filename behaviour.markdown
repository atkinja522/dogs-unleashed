### Understand Your Dog's Language and Strengthen Your Bond

Dogs don’t act out of defiance — they communicate through body language and subtle cues. I’ll teach you to understand that language so you can truly know what your dog is trying to tell you and address issues before they escalate. When you learn to see the world through your dog’s eyes, everyday life becomes easier for both of you.

### Why It Matters

Most behavioural challenges — like barking, pulling, reactivity, and anxiety — begin with misunderstanding. Your dog may be fearful, overstimulated, or unsure of what’s expected. By learning to read their body language, assess the situation, and respond appropriately, you’ll build trust, reduce frustration, and create a peaceful home with happier walks.

### What You’ll Master

 - How to read subtle canine body language
 - The difference between excitement, fear, stress, and playfulness
 - How your tone of voice, posture, and movement affect your dog’s behaviour
 - How to respond in a way that makes sense to your dog, encouraging cooperation
 - Practical, reward-based training techniques grounded in clear communication

### Who It’s For

 - Every current dog owner
 - Anyone bringing a puppy into their home
 - Those adopting or rehoming a dog

### Puppy Coaching

Welcoming a new puppy is exciting — but it can also be overwhelming. I offer tailored support to help you raise a confident, well-mannered pup through gentle, reward-based methods.

You’ll learn how to guide your puppy through key early stages, including:

 - Toilet training
 - Biting and chewing
 - Calm behaviour in the home
 - Socialisation and confidence-building
 - Walking nicely on a lead
 - Reliable recall


Early training is about more than commands — it’s about communication, trust, and creating a strong foundation for a happy life together. Let’s set your puppy up for success from day one.

### Support for Adopted & Rehomed Dogs

Bringing an adopted or rehomed dog into your life is a meaningful and rewarding experience — but it can come with unique challenges. Your new companion may need time to adjust, build trust, and feel safe in their new environment.

I’ll help you understand your dog’s past experiences, recognise signs of stress or uncertainty, and respond with empathy and clarity.

We’ll work together on:

 - Building trust and emotional safety
 - Settling into a new routine
 - Understanding and addressing fear-based behaviours
 - Creating calm, consistent communication
 - Boosting confidence and connection

Every adopted dog deserves a second chance — and you don’t have to navigate it alone. With the right support, your dog can thrive in their new home.

When you truly connect with your dog, training becomes easier, your bond grows stronger, and unwanted behaviours naturally fade. Whether you need help with recall, lead manners, socialisation, general behaviour, or confidence-building, I’m here to guide you every step of the way.

I work on a one-to-one basis, with each lesson specifically tailored to you and your dog’s individual needs.
