## About Me

Hi, I’m Elise! I founded Dogs Unleashed in 2016 to turn my passion for animals into a career, providing the dogs of Lancaster with enriching walks in the stunning local countryside.

I hold a BSc in Animal Behaviour and an HND in Animal Welfare and Management from Harper Adams University. My experience spans animal rescue centres, zoos, farms, and pet stores. After university, I returned home to work for a local dog walking company. When they decided to go in a different direction, I took the leap and created Dogs Unleashed — and I’ve never looked back!

With over 10 years of hands-on experience, I’ve had the privilege of working with dogs of all breeds, temperaments, and life experiences. I’ve dedicated my career to understanding canine body language, group dynamics, and positive reinforcement training, always staying up to date through continuous learning and research.

## My Approach

Dogs are more than just pets — they’re loyal companions who bring joy, connection, and unconditional love into our lives. I believe the bond between humans and dogs is truly special, built on trust, understanding, and mutual respect.

That’s why I focus on building trust with your dog through consistency, clear communication, and positive reinforcement. Every walk is an opportunity to nurture confidence, encourage natural behaviours like sniffing and exploring, and make sure each dog feels safe, happy, and fulfilled.

## Why Choose Dogs Unleashed? 

Walking dogs is more than just a job for me — it’s a chance to connect with each dog as an individual, understand their unique personality, and ensure their physical and mental needs are met.

With a reputation for reliability, compassionate care, and full insurance, many of my wonderful clients have entrusted their dogs to me for over a decade. You can rest easy knowing your beloved companion is in experienced, caring hands. 

My goal is to help unleash your dog’s full potential, ensuring they lead a happy, balanced, and enriched life.
