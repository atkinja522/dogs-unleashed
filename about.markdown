Hi, I’m Elise and I founded Dogs Unleashed in 2016 to fulfil my dream of providing the dogs of Lancaster with enriching walks amongst the beautiful local area.

I have a HND degree in Animal Welfare and a BSc degree in Animal Behaviour from Harper Adams University, I have worked in animal rescue centres, zoos, farms and a pet store. After university I came home and started with another local dog walking company and when they decided to go a different route, I started Dogs Unleashed and have never looked back!

I have over ten years of experience working with and enjoying the company of dogs of all breeds, temperaments and life experiences I have thorough knowledge of canine body language, canine group dynamics and positive training methods.

I walk dogs in small groups depending on their abilities and needs, to make the walk harmonious and enjoyable for all. I walk in all weathers* so your dog must be happy to come out and play in the rain.

I am reliable, fully insured and I collect and drop off your dog at your home in my crated van.

If you would like your dog to join our adventures and your dog is social, over 12 months (18months for large breeds), fit enough for a 90min walk, lives in Lancaster, vaccinated, up to date with flea, worms, tick treatments/titre tested and neutered please contact me for more information.

*Extreme weather conditions not applicable. Extreme weather that will have an adverse effect on your dog’s health will be cancelled or altered, though this is very rare.
